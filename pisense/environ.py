    """
    The :class:`SenseEnviron` class represents the suite of environmental
    sensors on the Sense HAT. Users can either instantiate this class
    themselves, or can access an instance from :attr:`SenseHAT.environ`.

    The :attr:`temperature`, :attr:`pressure`, and :attr:`humidity` attributes
    can be queried to read the current values from the sensors. Alternatively,
    the instance can be treated as an iterator in which case readings will be
    yielded as they are detected::

        hat = SenseHAT()
        for reading in hat.environ:
            print(reading.temperature)

    Because both the pressure and humidity sensors contain a temperature
    sensor, a source must be selected for the temperature reading. By default
    this is from the pressure sensor only, but you can specify a function for
    :attr:`temperature_source` which, given the two temperature readings
    returns the reading you are interested in, or some combination there-of.

    The *settings* parameter can be used to point to alternate settings files.
    The *temp_source* parameter provides an initial value for the
    :attr:`temp_source` attribute (this defaults to :func:`temp_humidity`). If
    the *emulate* parameter is ``True``, the instance will connect to the
    environment sensors in the `desktop Sense HAT emulator`_ instead of the
    "real" Sense HAT's sensors.
    The *interval* parameter is used to determine how often to read from the 
    state of the sensors. This can be used injunction with the iterator or read
    to control how often a reading is taken.
